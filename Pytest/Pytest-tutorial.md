- **Coverage library** is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. 
- It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not. 
- Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of tests.

### Install Coverage

```
### Run Coverage
